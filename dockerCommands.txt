### Useful Docker info
# If your docker build images are built to run as a specific user, be sure to add the following.  By default, the serviceaccount responsible for the UID of the pods will not let the container run as root (/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml specifies the UID start range)

oadm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z default

oc edit scc anyuid (adding additional name spaces as necessary) 

# In order to push, you need to authenticate to the internal OSE registry
# You also need additonal policies applied to your userName
oadm policy add-role-to-user admin userName -n openshift
oadm policy add-rolt-to-user system:image-builder userName
oadm policy add-rolt-to-user system:image-puller userName
oadm policy add-rolt-to-user system:image-pruner userName
oadm policy add-rolt-to-user system:image-pusher userName

oc login -u userName
docker login -u userName -p $(oc whoami -t) -e email@email (<-- doesn't need to be valid email) 172.30.X.X:5000 (<-- the internal registry service IP)
